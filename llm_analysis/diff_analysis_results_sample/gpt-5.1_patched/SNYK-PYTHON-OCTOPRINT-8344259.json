    "evidence": "Old code removed reauthentication/credential freshness checks before performing sensitive actions (e.g., generating/deleting API keys and accessing full user data including API keys). Specifically, @require_credentials_checked_recently was removed from /access/users/<username>/apikey (POST/DELETE) and /settings/apikey (POST/DELETE), and UI logic that hid API keys when credentials were outdated was removed. This weakens CSRF protection by allowing long-lived sessions or CSRF attacks to trigger high-impact operations without recent user credential verification.",
