    "evidence": "The patch primarily refactors permission/role management, telemetry, and database migration logic, and removes an upload proxy endpoint in favor of direct axios GETs to user-provided URLs. It also adds HTML sanitization to the WYSIWYG preview using sanitize-html. None of the added or modified code constructs OS commands, manipulates object prototypes, or introduces XSS; in fact, the WYSIWYG change mitigates XSS. The removed upload proxy could affect SSRF behavior but is not among the CWE types requested. Therefore, the new code does not introduce CWE-506, CWE-79, CWE-1321, CWE-78, or CWE-77.",
