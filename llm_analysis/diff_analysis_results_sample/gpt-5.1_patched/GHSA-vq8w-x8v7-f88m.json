    "evidence": "OLD code in ldapcherry/__init__.py used html_escape (from html or cgi) consistently for escaping user-controlled data before template rendering. The NEW code replaces this with cgi.escape, which is deprecated and historically incomplete for HTML context handling. Reverting to the OLD code (removing NEW changes) would restore safer, more appropriate escaping behavior and thus avoid the XSS risk introduced by the NEW code. Therefore, the OLD code is not vulnerable, but the NEW code is; adding OLD and removing NEW would not introduce XSS. However, since the question asks if the OLD code was vulnerable, the answer is false for vulnerabilities in OLD code.",
