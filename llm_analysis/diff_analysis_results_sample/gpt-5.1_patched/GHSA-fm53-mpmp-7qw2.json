    "evidence": "In the OLD code, SVG uploads were sanitized server-side using enshrined\\svgSanitize\\Sanitizer before being stored, reducing the risk of uploading malicious SVGs. The NEW code removes this sanitizer and all related configuration, meaning SVG files (image/svg*) are no longer cleaned. Reintroducing the OLD code would restore the sanitization and thus *reduce* risk; conversely, its removal in the NEW code creates a CWE-434 (Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type) risk. Therefore, the OLD code itself is not vulnerable; it was the mitigation. However, per the task framing (adding OLD and removing NEW), this change set results in CWE-434 due to loss of SVG sanitization.",
