    "evidence": "The removed OLD code is primarily high-level Rust and shell/JS glue without manual buffer management or unsafe blocks. It uses safe abstractions (Vec, String, serde, hyper, tokio, etc.) and does not perform unchecked indexing in a way that can panic on null pointers or cause out-of-bounds memory access at the language level. While there are potential logic bugs and panics (e.g., unwraps on regex captures, JSON fields, and URL segments), these map to controlled panics rather than memory safety issues. No unbounded native resource allocation patterns directly matching CWE-770 (like unbounded thread creation or file descriptor leaks) are evident beyond typical network I/O. Therefore, none of CWE-787, CWE-125, CWE-120, CWE-770, or CWE-476 are clearly present in the OLD code.",
