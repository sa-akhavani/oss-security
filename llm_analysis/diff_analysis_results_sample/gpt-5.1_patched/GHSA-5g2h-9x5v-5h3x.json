    "evidence": "In the OLD code, class_value/1 always applies attr_escape/1 to the class attribute value, but the build_attrs clauses for \"class\" and :class pass the result directly into the HTML without additional escaping. The NEW code removes attr_escape from class_value/1 and instead relies on the generic build_attrs path (which does escape), but the OLD code\u2019s ordering of build_attrs clauses means list-valued class attributes are handled by the special class_value path and then not escaped again. If class_value receives {:safe, data} or other pre-encoded content, it is passed through attr_escape, which for {:safe, data} returns data unescaped, allowing attacker-controlled HTML/JS to be injected into the class attribute, leading to XSS.",
