    "evidence": "OLD code in taguette/web/views.py used html_safe_json_dumps to escape '<' characters in JSON embedded into HTML templates, preventing user-controlled strings (e.g., document names, tag paths, user_login) from breaking out of <script> contexts. NEW code removed this helper and now injects raw json.dumps output into Markup without escaping '<', so a crafted value containing '</script><script>...' could lead to XSS. Therefore, reverting to the OLD code (which had the escaping) would remove this XSS risk, meaning the OLD code was not vulnerable; the NEW code is. However, per the question's framing (\"adding the OLD code and removing the NEW code would introduce vulnerabilities\"), the answer is that the OLD code is safe with respect to the listed CWEs.",
