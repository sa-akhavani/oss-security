    "evidence": "The changes tighten directory handling (normalizing destination path, ensuring it ends with a separator, and checking existence) and preserve/strengthen the existing path traversal guard using StartsWith against the normalized destination directory. No dynamic code generation, web output, manual heap management, or unsafe buffer operations are introduced. The Zip EOCD search change only adjusts the search range and does not affect memory safety. The Tar padding change uses a safe arithmetic alignment to 512-byte boundaries and writes a bounded stackalloc buffer. None of the modified code paths introduce CWE-94, CWE-79, CWE-122, CWE-416, or CWE-22 vulnerabilities beyond the pre-existing behavior, and the path traversal mitigation remains in place and consistent with the normalized base path.",
