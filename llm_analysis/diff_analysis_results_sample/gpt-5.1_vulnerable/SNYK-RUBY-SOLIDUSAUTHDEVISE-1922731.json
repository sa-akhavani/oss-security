    "evidence": "The changes primarily refactor soft-deletion behavior (switching to acts_as_paranoid), adjust controller callbacks to use load_object earlier, and remove a CSRF-related test file without altering forgery protection configuration in the controller itself. No new user-controlled data is rendered unsafely (XSS), no regex changes were introduced (ReDoS), no dynamic code evaluation was added (Code Injection), no filesystem path handling was modified (Path Traversal), and the UsersController update/create actions\u2019 CSRF behavior is unchanged in the application code (only tests were removed). Therefore, none of the listed CWEs are newly introduced by the added code.",
