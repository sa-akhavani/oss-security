    "evidence": "Multiple changes harden HTML escaping and URL handling. Previously, JSPWikiMarkupParser.escapeHTMLEntities was a private method in the parser; some link texts and sections (e.g., in createAnchor, LOCAL footnote links, and flushPlainText) were not consistently escaped or relied on that local method. The patch centralizes escaping in TextUtil.escapeHTMLEntities and applies it in more places, including when rendering LOCAL links and markdown WikiHtmlInline content, preventing unescaped user-controlled content from being injected into HTML. Additionally, the Image plugin now blocks data: and javascript: URLs when HTML is disallowed, which mitigates script injection via image src. The old code allowed these vectors, constituting stored/reflected XSS (CWE-79).",
