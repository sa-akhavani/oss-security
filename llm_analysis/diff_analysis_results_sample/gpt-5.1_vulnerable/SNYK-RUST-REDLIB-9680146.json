    "evidence": "The patch only removes multiple Rust source files and shell/JS helpers, leaving a reduced utils.rs. The remaining code uses safe Rust constructs (Vec, String, indexing guarded by checks, no unsafe, no manual pointer or raw buffer arithmetic). Indexing into JSON arrays and strings is preceded by length/option checks, and string slicing is only done after verifying non-empty and known lengths. There are no dynamic allocations without limits beyond typical web application behavior, and no use of null pointers in Rust. Therefore, none of CWE-787, CWE-125, CWE-120, CWE-770, or CWE-476 are introduced by the new code state.",
