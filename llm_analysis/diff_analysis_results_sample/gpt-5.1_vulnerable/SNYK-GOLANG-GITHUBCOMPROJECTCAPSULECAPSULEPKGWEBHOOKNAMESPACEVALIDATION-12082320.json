    "evidence": "In the old code, non-tenant-owners attempting to patch a namespace labeled with a tenant caused an event to be recorded on the Tenant object (recorder.Eventf(tnt, ...)), but the admission was correctly denied. The patch changes the logic so that only tenant owners are allowed (returns nil) and all others are denied with an event on the Namespace instead. This indicates the previous authorization check was inverted relative to the intended policy, constituting incorrect authorization (CWE-863) that the patch corrects.",
