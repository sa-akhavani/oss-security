    "evidence": "Multiple endpoints that manage or reveal sensitive API keys and user data had reauthentication/credential freshness checks removed. For example, in server/api/access.py the delete_apikey_for_user and generate_apikey_for_user routes no longer require require_credentials_checked_recently, and in server/api/settings.py the generateApiKey and deleteApiKey routes also had this protection removed. Corresponding frontend viewmodels (access.js, settings.js, usersettings.js, loginstate.js) removed logic that hides API keys when credentials are outdated and no longer enforce reauthentication before key generation/deletion or user listing. This weakens CSRF protections by allowing long-lived authenticated sessions to perform sensitive state-changing actions without recent user interaction, increasing susceptibility to CSRF attacks (CWE-352).",
