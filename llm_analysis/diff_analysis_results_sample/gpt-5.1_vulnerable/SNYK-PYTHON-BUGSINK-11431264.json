    "evidence": "In bugsink/context_processors.py, EMAIL_BACKEND_WARNING is constructed with mark_safe around an HTML string that includes a link. If settings.EMAIL_BACKEND or related configuration were ever influenced by user-controlled input (e.g., misconfiguration or injection via admin), this would be rendered without escaping, enabling XSS. Additionally, multiple views (e.g., issues/views.py, projects/views.py, teams/views.py) render data from events and issues (such as exception messages, log messages, tag values, and other event fields) into templates without clear evidence of consistent escaping or safe handling. Since these fields originate from ingested event payloads controlled by external clients, any use of mark_safe or unescaped insertion in templates can lead to stored XSS. The diff shows new model and view layers that expose such data but does not show corresponding robust output encoding, so the new code introduces a likely CWE-79 risk.",
