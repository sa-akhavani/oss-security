    "evidence": "In backend/apps/webui/routers/files.py, the NEW code removes all per-user access control checks on file operations. Endpoints like list_files, get_file_by_id, get_file_content_by_id, and delete_file_by_id previously enforced that the requesting user either owned the file (file.user_id == user.id) or was an admin. The patched code now returns or serves any file record and its underlying path-based FileResponse to any authenticated user, regardless of ownership. Since file.meta['path'] is used directly to construct a Path and serve the file, a malicious user can enumerate file IDs belonging to other users and retrieve or delete arbitrary files within the upload storage, constituting an improper restriction of file access akin to a path traversal / arbitrary file access issue (CWE-22).",
