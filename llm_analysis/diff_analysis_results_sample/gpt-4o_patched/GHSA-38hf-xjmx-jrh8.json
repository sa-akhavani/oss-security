    "evidence": "The new code in TypeAheadInput.jsx and QueryInput.ts uses lodash.escape to sanitize user input, which is a positive change. However, the previous implementation did not sanitize input at all, indicating that the patch is addressing a potential XSS vulnerability. The presence of lodash.escape suggests an attempt to mitigate XSS, but if not used consistently or correctly, it could still be vulnerable.",
