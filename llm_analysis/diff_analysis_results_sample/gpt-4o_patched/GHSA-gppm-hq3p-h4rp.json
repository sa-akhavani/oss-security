    "evidence": "The OLD code included a TeamAllowlistChecker that was used to verify user permissions for executing commands. This checker was removed in the NEW code, which could indicate that the OLD code had a more restrictive authorization mechanism. The removal of this checker in the NEW code suggests that the OLD code was enforcing additional authorization checks that are no longer present, potentially leading to incorrect authorization in the NEW code.",
