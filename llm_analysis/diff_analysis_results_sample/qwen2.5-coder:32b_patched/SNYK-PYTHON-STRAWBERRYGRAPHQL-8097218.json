    "evidence": "The removal of multipart_uploads_enabled in the old code could imply that CSRF protection through disabling multipart form data uploads was removed. While this is not a direct introduction but an implication from another change, enabling multipart uploads without proper CSRF protection can lead to vulnerabilities like CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery). The 'dispatch' methods were marked with @method_decorator(csrf_exempt) in the new code, suggesting that CSRF was intentionally bypassed. If multipart_uploads_enabled being True allowed file uploads or form data submissions and the old code assumed this could be done freely, it is a potential security risk if these actions require CSRF protection.",
